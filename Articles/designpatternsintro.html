                <h2>Intro to Design Pattern</h2> 
            </header> 
            <p>
            During my last two years of Secondary High School and my first year of university, I came across many students and 
            Freelance developers. 
            Having a chat with them, I discovered that most of them didnâ€™t know the meaning of: design pattern.

            <br></br>
            So, What is a design pattern?
            
            <br></br>
            A design pattern is a <strong>re-usable form of a solution</strong> to a design problem.A Design Pattern is a 
            description or template for how to solve a problem that can potentially be used in a different situation. 
            An organized set of design pattern relates to the same field is called pattern language. 
            
            All the Design Pattern can seed up to the development process by providing testes and proved development paradigms.  
            In order to achieve flexibility, most of the design patterns introduce an additional level of indirection.

                <h3>Documentation of a Design Pattern</h3>

            <p>
            The documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used. 
            Reading the documentation, you will know:</br>
            <strong>Pattern Name</strong></br>
            <strong>Intent:</strong> the description of the goal behind the pattern and why use it. 
            Situations in which the pattern is usable. </br>
            <strong>Graphical representation of the pattern</strong> description of the results and trade-offs caused by using the pattern. 
            A description of the implementation of the pattern. </br>
            <strong>Sample code:</strong> An illustration of how to the pattern can be used. </br>
           
            <br></br>
    
            Most patterns are not tied to a specific language and can be implemented in various frameworks.    
            Because design pattern is agnostic in nature, patterns are presented using UML diagrams. Optionally, the pattern is 
            illustrated in code using a concise email in a specific programming language (C++, Java etc...).
            It is necessary that the language used is not important as far as a pattern is concerned. Many patterns can also be 
            applied in non-object oriented programming languages such as C.
