        <h1>STUDY IN UK, WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW</h1>

<p>
    As you may know, I moved in UK to study Computer Science at the Edinburgh Napier University. 
    <br>
    Since I started to to study here, many students of my ex secondary school started asking me advices and practice path to being accepted 
    from one or more university in UK.

    Here, you will find a guide that will exaplian you how to:
    <ul>
    <li>Start your application.</li>
    <li>Open a bank account in UK.</li>
    <li>Find an accomodation.</li>
    <li>Get financial support if needed.</li>
    <li>Best way to find a part-time Job. </li>
    <li>Get an English sim card.</li> 
    <li>Save money.</li>
    </ul>

</p>

           <h2>Document you need</h2>	

<p>Please, note that this article has been <strong>written before  the attuation of brexit</strong> and for this reason, I would suggest you to double check in the 
    Uk government website if there is any time limit restriction to live and study in Uk in according to your citizenship. 
    If you are an international student, what you really need is a passport. 
    Many non -electronic Identity Card will not be longer accepted as proof of identity 
    finalized to open a bank account aor across the border. 
    The safest and fastest way to proof your identity is showing your E-passport. 
<br> </br>
If you are italian, the overall cost of a passport will be about 105 euros and you will need to wait between 2 and 4 weeks since the date of your application. 
<br> </br>
Once arrived in Uk, you will need to get the <a href= "https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number" target = "_blank" >National Insurance number </a>to be able to work , get any economical benefit , get a student loan or open a bank account.  
Mind that you can however start to work also before getting you National Insurance Number, however, let your employer know that you have already applied for it. 
<br> </br>
If you are a NON-EUROPEAN citizen, you will probably need a VISA. Please double check as soon as possible how to apply for a VISA. Before to apply for a VISA, you will need to pass first the <a href = "https://www.ielts.org/" target = "_blank" > IELTS test.</a>  

Once you will get your IELTS certification, you will be able to apply for the VISA. 

<br> </br>
Personally, I have applied to the <a href = "https://www.britishcouncil.org/" target = "_blank">British Council website</a>  for the IELTS Test. Please, start to study and book your exam as soon as possible. 
If you will fail the exam, make sure that you will have enough  time to resit again and send the documentation to the university. 
I failed the first time because the overall marks was not high enough to being accepted and I tried again. If you have a chance, after you diploma go to spend a
couple of month working in London and book your exam in one of the examination center in London , Edinburgh  , Glasgow etc... . 
<br> </br>
If you would like to know more information about the IELTS examination center , double check the list <a href = "https://www.ielts.org/book-a-test/find-a-test-location" target = "_blank" > here. </a>

If you are going to study in UK, USA, Australia ,make sure to apply for the <a href = "https://www.ielts.org/about-the-test/two-types-of-ielts-test" target = "_blank" >Academic IELTS exam.  </a>

If you have already a Driving Licence, you can convert it in a English Driving licence. <p>

        <h2>Start your application</h2>

<p>To start your adventure in Uk you have to use <a href = "https://www.ucas.com/" target = "_blank" >UCAS</a>  platform to start your application.  UCAS is a platform that connects all the students from the world to all the universities in Uk. 

On U<a href = "https://www.ucas.com/" target = "_blank" >UCAS</a> , you can choose five different university and apply to them at the same time. Choose your university considering where you would like to study, considering the global university ranking and your school grades.

Having five options, you can use three of them to apply to your favorite universities and other two options as “plan B” to be sure to being accepted by at least by one university.

<br><br>
The first round of students selection is made by the students recruiter analyzing the <strong>Personal statement </strong>of the student.
<br><br>A Personal statement is a document that describes the quality of the student and her/his main goals in the next few years. The best presentation of a candidate is a personal statement convalidated by an English Letter and a recommendation letter, finalised to confirm the skills of the candidate.

Every university, has different criteria for the <strong>student selection.</strong> All the university will consider:
<ul>
    <li>Your marks in English.</li>
    <li>Overall grades in the IELTS certification.</li>
    <li>Overall Grade Diploma certification of the Secondary High School.</li>
    <li>Marks related to the subjects of the university Course.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you would like to apply for Computer Science Course, they will probably asks for your grades in Math.   <p>
</p>
        <h2>Open a bank account</h2>

<p>To open a bank account in UK, you will need the National Insurance Number. Because you will need to wait at least 7 weeks before to the your NIN, the best option to get a VALID UK bank account is to open a bank account.

There are plenty options, the best two are:
<ul>
<li> <a href = "https://monese.com/" target = "_blank"> Monzo:</a> it is based in London and you will be able to use it as Credit Card with direct debit. You can as well get cash  withdrawal using any ATM.</li>   
<li> <a href = "https://monzo.com/" target = "_blank"> Monese:</a>  you will be able to get  cash withdrawal and use any post Office to transfer money into your bank account.</li> 
</ul>

<p>I suggest to use <strong>both</strong> bank account. 

I use both of them. To get a bank account, download the application of each bank in your mobile, sign up, provide your personal information and wait to get your card via post. <p>


<h2> How to find an accomodation </h2>

<p>
    As a student, you can double check if your university provides any student accommodation contacting them via email or having a look to the website of the uni when you would like to being accepted. 

    Other options to find a private an accommodation can be using:
    <ul>
    <li> <a href = "spareroom" target = " _blank">SpareRoom</a>  </li>
    <li> <a href = "https://www.gumtree.com/" target = " _blank">GumTree</a>  </li>
    </ul>
    <br></br>
</p>
<p>
    Remember : never pay anything in advanced before have seen the accommodation / flat / room. Try as well to pay always 
    with money transfer using your bank account instead to pay in cash, to have always track of your payment.
</p>

    <h2>Get financial support </h2>

<p>
    First of all, If you are a student, you don’t need to pay any council tax (this is a low in all UK).
    If you would like to <strong>study in Scotland,</strong> you can apply to <a href ="https://www.saas.gov.uk/" target = "_blank" >SAAS</a> , a Student Award Agency in Scotland that can potentially pay for university tuition fees for any academic year.

    To apply to <a href ="https://www.saas.gov.uk/" target = "_blank" >SAAS</a>, I have use the passport as proof of identity (strongly suggest), and provide all documents requested. 


    if would like to study in Ireland or Britain ,  double check  for any student <strong>student bursary</strong> 
    provided by the  university and your home country.<p> 

    <h2>Best way to find a part-time Job </h2>

<p>
    Almost all the international students needs to find a part-time Job to be able to pay their bills.
    If you are living in London, the best way to find a job is using <a hjref = " https://web.jobtoday.com/" target = "_blank"><strong>Job today</strong> </a>.
    If you are living outside Edinburgh, I personally suggest you to print out your CV and and go around the city trying to give as many CVs you can in few night.
    For the international students of the first  and second year, the best way to find a job is to work in hospitality. 
</p>

        <h2>Have an English SIM CARD</h2>

<p>
    To work and live in uk, you need an English Sim card. 
    The best and cheapest options are: 
    <ul>
        <li> <a href = " https://www.giffgaff.com/" target = "_blanck" > <strong>Giffgaff:</strong></a>  it is really chip and you can get a SIM via post for 
            free also in your home country (outside UK). </li>
        <li> <a href = " https://www.vodafone.co.uk/" target = "_blanck" >  <strong>Vodafone</strong></a></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
Make sure to have an english card also before to arrive in UK if possible and keep your contacts details updated in your CV.  
</p>

					<h2>How to save money</h2>

<p>
    In UK every student has amazing benefit from an economical point of view. 
    All the public transport companies and most of bars, restaurants , bookshops , barber-shops and so on , 
    offer discounts to students.

    Whatever you are doing, ask if you can get any student discount and be able to show your student card if needed.
