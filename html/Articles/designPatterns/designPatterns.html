        <h1>Design Patterns</h1>
        <p>
            During my last two years of Secondary High School and my first year of university, 
            I came across many students and Freelance developers. Having a chat with them, 
            I saw that most of them didnâ€™t know the meaning of: Design Pattern.

            So, What is a design pattern?
            
            A design pattern is the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem.It is a description 
            or template for how to solve a problem that can potentially be used in a different situation. 
            An organized set of design pattern relates to the same field is called pattern language. 
            
            
            All the Design Pattern can <strong>speed up</strong> to the development process by providing 
            teste and proved development paradigms.<br> 
        </p>

                                    <h3>Main type of Design Pattern</h3>
        
        <p>

            There are mainly three types of design patterns:
            <br/>
            <strong>1. Creational</strong>
            These design patterns are all about class instantiation or 
            object creation. These patterns can be further categorized 
            into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. 
            While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in 
            the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use 
            delegation effectively to get the job done.
            
            Creational design patterns are Factory Method, Abstract Factory, 
            Builder, Singleton, Object Pool and Prototype.
            <br/>
            <strong>2. Structural</strong>
            These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
            
            Structural design patterns are Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data and Proxy.
            <br/>
            <strong>3. Behavioral</strong>
            Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.

                                     <h3>Documentation of a Design Pattern</h3>
            
        <p>
            The documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used. 
            Reading the documentation, you will know the: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul style = 'text-align: left; padding-left: 21%;'>
                <li> <strong>The Pattern Name:</strong> name of the <br/></li>
                <li><strong>Intent:</strong> the description of the goal behind the pattern and why use it. 
                 Situations in which the pattern is usable.<br/></li>
                <li><strong>Graphical representation of the pattern.</strong><br/></li>
                <li><strong>Participants:</strong> a list of classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Consequences: description of the results and trade-offs caused by using the pattern. 
                    A description of the implementation of the pattern. <br/></li>
                <li><strong>Sample code:</strong> An illustration of how to the pattern can be used. <br/></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>   
        <p>
            Optionally, the pattern is illustrated in code using a concise email in a specific programming language 
            (C++, Java etc...).
            It is necessary that the language used is not important as far as a pattern is concerned. 
            Many patterns can also be applied in non-object oriented programming languages such as C.
